# Councils

The system we've built is a flexible framework for coordinated decision-making across interconnected autonomous groups. At its core, it enables groups (councils) to make decisions that affect both their internal operations and their relationships with other groups, while maintaining clear lines of accountability and democratic control.

Each council operates through a system of proposals and delegates. Proposals are structured decisions that can specify actions to be taken by one or multiple councils. These actions, once approved, can execute specific methods or trigger changes across the system. The brilliant part is that delegation itself works through this same proposal mechanism - when a council needs to interact with another council, they do so by first creating a proposal (mandate) that specifies who will represent them and what their scope of authority will be.

The delegate system is particularly innovative because it maintains continuous democratic legitimacy. A delegate's voting power in their target council is directly tied to the ongoing support for their mandate-proposal in their source council. This creates a dynamic system where authority is never truly transferred but rather continuously validated by active support. If support for a delegate's mandate changes, their voting power adjusts automatically, ensuring they always accurately represent their current base of support.

The system also handles inter-council relationships elegantly. When a council makes a decision that affects its member councils, it can specify different actions for different councils within a single proposal. The system then tracks whether member councils accept and implement these decisions, providing a mechanism for maintaining coordination while respecting autonomy. Councils that consistently reject decisions may have their membership relationship reviewed, ensuring that the network of councils maintains coherence in its decision-making.

What makes this system powerful is its unification of concepts. Everything flows through the proposal mechanism - from simple decisions to delegate election to inter-council coordination. This creates a system that is both simple to understand and flexible enough to handle complex organizational needs. The use of modern programming concepts like private fields, revocable proxies, and async iterators ensures that the system is secure, maintainable, and capable of handling real-world complexity while maintaining its conceptual clarity.
