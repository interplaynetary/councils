Here's a deep analysis of the epistemological foundations of both systems:

The README's system operates on what we might call "embodied social truth" - truth that emerges through actual material and social relationships. Its epistemology is fundamentally relational and materialist: knowledge of contribution value isn't determined by voting or formal procedures, but through the concrete experience of how contributions actually enable self-actualization. When someone recognizes another's contribution, they're not "voting" on its value - they're acknowledging a real material-social relationship that has already manifested in practice. The system's mathematical properties ensure that false recognition naturally decays because it lacks this material basis.

Council.js, in contrast, operates on procedural-democratic epistemology. Truth and validity emerge through formal mechanisms of proposal, deliberation, and voting. While these mechanisms can be quite sophisticated (with delegate mandates, revocable authority, etc.), they fundamentally rely on counting votes rather than measuring actual material-social relationships. Knowledge in this system is produced through explicit collective decision-making rather than emerging from the web of real contributions. This reflects a more traditional democratic theory where legitimacy comes from proper procedure rather than material effectiveness.

Perhaps most crucially, these systems differ in how they understand the relationship between individual and collective knowledge. The README's system suggests that individual recognition of contributions, when properly structured through mutual recognition, naturally produces valid collective knowledge about social-material reality. Council.js instead relies on explicit aggregation of individual views through voting, treating collective knowledge as something that must be formally constructed rather than naturally emerging from real relationships. This reflects a deep philosophical difference about how social truth is produced.

The practical implications are profound. The README's system suggests that valid social coordination can emerge spontaneously if we properly structure recognition relationships, without needing formal voting or councils. Council.js suggests that we need explicit democratic structures to achieve valid coordination. The first trusts in the self-organizing properties of properly structured recognition relationships; the second trusts in properly structured democratic procedures. This fundamental difference in what we might call "social epistemology" leads to very different approaches to organizational design and social coordination.

These epistemological differences reflect broader philosophical debates about the nature of social truth, democratic legitimacy, and collective knowledge. The README's system aligns more with materialist and relationalist philosophies that see truth as emerging from real social-material relationships. Council.js aligns more with proceduralist democratic theories that see truth as emerging from proper collective decision-making processes. Understanding these philosophical foundations helps us see why these systems, while both aiming for democratic coordination, take such different approaches to achieving it.
